**Audify** is your personal AI audio producer. Here‚Äôs how you can create your audiobook snippet:

1.  **Choose Your Narrator:** Start by selecting the default voice you'd like for the story's narration from the gallery of characters.

2.  **Upload a Page:** Provide a clear image of a book page you want to bring to life.

3.  **AI Text Analysis:** The app performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the text, identifies any new characters, and corrects potential scanning errors.

4.  **Intelligent Voice Casting:** For any characters found in dialogue, the AI automatically assigns the best-fitting voices from its library, complementing the narrator you chose.

5.  **Audio Generation:** The story is converted to speech, with each character (and your chosen narrator) speaking their lines.

6.  **Final Audiobook:** All audio clips are seamlessly combined into your finished audiobook, ready to be played and downloaded.
